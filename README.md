# Simple-Problems-with-Verification

Hello, This repo is for Practicing few easy RTL design problems with solution.

I'm using Lattice Semiconductor's Radiant Software for solving these Problems
### 1. Implement NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR gate using 2-to-1 MUX in a single unit.
### 2. Implemetation of various registers.
