# Simple-Problems-with-Verification

Hello, This repo is for Practicing few easy RTL design problems with solution.

I'm using Lattice Semiconductor's Radiant Software for solving these Problems
### 1. Implement NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR gate using 2-to-1 MUX in a single unit.
### 2. Implement 4-to-1 MUX using 2-to-1 MUXs.
### 3. RTL for a 3-input sorting logic.
### 4. RTL Design for an LRU cache replacement policy, consider a 4-way cache.
